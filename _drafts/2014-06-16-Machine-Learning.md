WEKA open-source project in machine learning: containing tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. The Weka project was started in 1992 business intelligence features

given an IoT data set, the machine learning algorithm has to deduce a logic based on a pattern in the data.

Machine learning techniques we explore are:

Supervised and unsupervised learning
Neural Networks
Machine Learning System Design
Clustering
Anomaly Detection
Recommendation Systems
Large-Scale Machine learning systems
Programming paradigms and Languages for machine learning
Computation at the edge or Computation at the core


Setting the Stage: IoT and Machine Learning
This talk will cover strategies to apply machine learning algorithms to IoT data

Monitoring Bikes and Bikers in Washington DC
There is an explosion of sensor data becoming available, leading to the term Internet of Things.  But how difficult is it to pull all that data together and to do something sensible with it?  In this paper, we pull 8 sensory data sources and transform and enrich the data to create profiles and segments around customers that were not available before.  We then apply time series analysis, geo-localization, and image visualization to take that data and make it actionable.   Public data sources as well as open source software is used so that a working example can be shared with all Rosaria Silipo, Data Mining consultant, DMR

Three Machine Learning applications in the Industry
The practical applications of IoT in the Industry and what opportunities it holds for even small and medium sized companies that have limited resources. Starting with my experience from doing HutGrip and working in Chattanooga, Tennessee manufacturing companies to figure out what is the biggest ROI they can see and get right away from an IoT solution. The industries we explored include Printing and Packaging, Food Production, Wine production, Textiles and Carpet Manufacturing Induction Heating – and we have talked and worked with the small and medium sized companies. We will explore their perspective and understating about how this technology can help and what are the benefits and challenges they see. What are some specific ways they use Data Analytics algorithms to help them solve problems? We will see some of the algorithms that we have implemented and are also widely spread including – forecasting algorithms using STL decomposition optimized for time-series data. We will also explore more complex algorithms like anomaly detection and building Neural Networks for time series prediction and modelling.
