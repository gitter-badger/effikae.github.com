Kevin Ashton, a British technology pioneer who co-founded the Auto-ID Center at MIT, which created a global standard system for RFID and other sensors, coined the phrase "Internet of Things" back in 1999. His Internet of Things (IoT) is a system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors. And sensors can be any device that gathers data and reports that data to a data collection facility such as a data warehouse, a database, or log server.

Any new field comes with its own concepts and jargon, so it's useful to map these out as clearly as possible: our taxonomy is outlined below. (Google trends)

Internet de las cosas es actualmente un concepto muy amplio que fué acuñado por Kevin Ashton en 1999. Su "Internet de las Cosas" era un sistema donde se conectaban a internet. Es útil 

Internet of Things is a broader concept, which will evolve from M2M and other technologies. IoT goes beyond M2M… beyond computers connecting to things. IoT represents things connecting with systems, people and other things, services, etc. 

The Internet of Things is not just about gathering of data but also about the analysis and use of data. 

M2M: remote access to machine data -> service management applications -> computer-connected humans observing Integration of device and sensor
data with Big Data, analytics. and other emerprise applications is, a core concept behind the emerging Internet
of Things.
